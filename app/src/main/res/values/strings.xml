    <string name="instructions">This app allows you to play all the amazing and critically
acclaimed songs from the award winning game \'The Legend of Melda - The Ukulele of Time\'!!\n
\n
Turning ON Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Advertising will broadcast a Custom BLE Service every time a song
is correctly played. The song\'s notes will also be broadcast along with the advertisement
inside the Custom Service Data payload. Each note is segmented into 4-bits inside the
Service Data payload byte array.\n
\n
The left most 4-bits of each byte will be a note and the rightmost 4-bits will be another
note.\n
\n
Example:\n
[1010100, 110101, 1000011]\n
1st byte: 0101 0100 = C Left + C Up\n
\n
Table:\n
A - 0001\n
C Down - 0010\n
C Right - 0011\n
C Up - 0100\n
C Left - 0101\n
\n
BLE Custom 128-bit UUID\n
UKULELE_SERVICE = 8F2A9690-FD82-4AA0-953E-79EF126BA95D\n
\n
Challenge:\n
1. Create an app that scans and listens for the above custom ble service.\n
2. Grab the service\'s data byte array.\n
3. Parse out the notes in the played song.\n
4. Print out on screen the notes in the correct order along with the name of the song.\n
